Welcome! 

I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh.

I received my Ph.D. in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 2023. 

My research interests are in microeconomic theory with a focus on learning, information, and dynamic games, as well as behavioral economics and experiments.

I am honored to be an invited speaker at the [Review of Economic Studies European Tour](https://www.restud.com/past-restud-tour-speakers/), 2023.
